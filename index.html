        JSON-LD [[JSON-LD]] offers a JSON-based serialization for Linked Data.
        One of the primary uses of JSON-LD is its ability to exchange RDF [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]] data across the Web.
        This can be done by first <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/#serialize-rdf-as-json-ld-algorithm">serializing RDF to JSON-LD</a>,
        after which data consumers can <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/#deserialize-json-ld-to-rdf-algorithm">deserialize JSON-LD to RDF</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since RDF datasets may contain many triples,
        and JSON-LD documents don't have size limits,
        such documents could in some cases become very large.
        For these cases, the ability to serialize and deserialize JSON-LD in a <em>streaming</em> way offers many advantages.
        Streaming processing allows large documents to be parsed with only a limited amount of memory,
        and processed chunks can be emitted as soon as they are processed,
        as opposed to waiting until the whole dataset or document has been processed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/">recommended processing algorithms</a>
        do not work in a streaming manner, as these first load all required data in memory,
        after which this data can be processed.
        This note discusses the processing of JSON-LD in a streaming manner.
        Concretely, a set of guidelines is introduced for efficiently serializing and deserializing JSON-LD in a streaming way.
        These guidelines are encapsulated in a JSON-LD streaming document form, and a streaming RDF form.
        These forms, when they are detected, allow implementations to apply streaming optimizations.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
          This document discusses the concerns on serializing and deserializing JSON-LD in a streaming manner.
          This document is primarily intended for the following audiences:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Software developers who want to implement streaming algorithms to serialize or deserialize JSON-LD documents.
          </li>
          <li>
              Web authors and developers who want to publish JSON-LD in a streaming manner.
          </li>
          <li>
              Web authors and developers who want to consume JSON-LD in a streaming manner.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          To understand the basics in this note you must first be familiar with
          <a data-cite="RFC8259" data-no-xref="">JSON</a>, which is detailed in [[RFC8259]]. You must also understand the
          JSON-LD syntax defined in the <a data-cite="JSON-LD11" data-no-xref="">JSON-LD 1.1 Syntax specification</a> [[JSON-LD11]],
          which is the base syntax used for streaming processing.
          To understand how JSON-LD maps to RDF, it is helpful to be
          familiar with the basic RDF concepts [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].

          There are <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#forms-of-json-ld">multiple ways of describing data in JSON-LD</a>,

      <section>
        <h3 id="key-ordering-importance">Importance of Key Ordering</h3>
        <p>
            The order in which key-value pairs occur in JSON-LD nodes conveys no meaning.
            For instance, the following two JSON-LD documents have the same meaning, even though they are syntactically different.
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Name, homepage and image come after @id">
          {
            "@context": "http://schema.org/",
            "@id": "https://www.rubensworks.net/#me",
            "name": "Ruben Taelman",
            "url": "https://www.rubensworks.net/",
            "image": "https://www.rubensworks.net/img/ruben.jpg"
          }
        </pre>
        <pre class="example" title="Name, homepage and image come before @id">
          {
            "@context": "http://schema.org/",
            "name": "Ruben Taelman",
            "url": "https://www.rubensworks.net/",
            "image": "https://www.rubensworks.net/img/ruben.jpg",
            "@id": "https://www.rubensworks.net/#me"
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
            In a streaming JSON-LD document, the order of certain keys is important.
            This is because streaming JSON-LD processors may require the presence of some keys before others can be processed,
            and ordering keys in certain ways may lead to better processing performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the two snippets before, the first example can be processed more efficiently by a streaming processor.
            Concretely, a streaming JSON-LD deserializer can emit an RDF triple each time a property (<code>"name"</code>, <code>"url"</code>, <code>"image"</code>) has been read, because the <code>"@id"</code> has been defined before.
            This is because the <code>"@id"</code> defines the RDF subject,
            the property key defines the RDF predicate,
            and the property value defines RDF object.
            This ensures that all required information is needed for constructing and emitting an RDF triple each time a property is encountered.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the second example, where the <code>"@id"</code> is only defined at the end,
            a streaming deserializer would have to <em>buffer</em> the properties until the <code>"@id"</code> key is encountered.
            Since the RDF subject of our triples is defined via <code>"@id"</code>,
            the RDF triples can only be emitted after this last key has been read.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3 id="key-ordering-required">Required Key Ordering</h3>
        <p>
            In order for a JSON-LD document to be a in a <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn" id="dfn-streaming-document-form">streaming document form</dfn>,
            the keys in each JSON node MUST be ordered according to the following order:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><code>@context</code></li>
            <li><code>@type</code></li>
            <li><em>Other properties</em></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Each of these keys is optional, and may be omitted.
            Only those that are present must occur in the following order.
        </p>
        <p>
            This order is important because <code>@context</code>
            can change the meaning of all following entries in the node and its children.
            Additionally, <code>@type</code> could indicate a <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#dfn-type-scoped-context">type-scoped context</a>,
            which may have the same implications of an <code>@context</code>.
            This means that these MUST always be processed before all other entries.
        </p>
        <div class="note" role="note" id="key-ordering-json">
            <p class="">
                Entries in nodes have a defined order when serialized as JSON.
                <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-4">However, this this order is not always kept by JSON parsing libraries</a>.
                This means that streaming processors MUST make use of JSON parsers that preserve this order to be effective.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="note" role="note" id="key-ordering-alias">
            <p class="">
                <code>@type</code> can be <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#aliasing-keywords">aliased</a> to other keys,
                for which the order also applies.
            </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3 id="key-ordering-recommended">Recommended Key Ordering</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to the <a href="#key-ordering-required">required key ordering</a>,
            an <code>@id</code> key SHOULD be present as the first entry of the other properties,
            right after <code>@context</code> and <code>@type</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            By placing <code>@id</code> before other properties in a node,
            streaming deserializers can determine the subject of this node early on,
            and they can immediately emit following properties as RDF triples as soon as they are read.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a node does not define an explicit <code>@id</code>,
            the subject of this node usually becomes an implicit <em>blank node</em>.
            To improve potential processing performance,
            it is recommended to always add an explicit <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-blank-node-identifier">blank node identifier</a> in these cases using <code>@id</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            While not recommended, <code>@id</code> can also come after any other properties,
            which requires the streaming deserializer to <em>buffer</em> these properties
            until an <code>@id</code> is read, or the node closes.
        </p>
        <div class="note" role="note" id="key-ordering-recommended-for-who">
            <p class="">
            This recommended key ordering SHOULD be followed by streaming document authors.
            Streaming processors implementations MUST NOT assume that a given streaming document will adhere to this recommendation.
            <br />
            If a processor sees that a document does not adhere to this recommendation, then it MAY produce a warning.

        <p>
            The order in which RDF triples occur in an RDF dataset convey no meaning.
            For instance, the following two RDF datasets (serialized in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle</a>) have the same meaning,
            even though they have a different order of triples.
        </p>

        <p>
            For streaming JSON-LD processors, the order of RDF triples may be important.
            Processors that read triples one by one, and convert them to a JSON-LD document in a streaming manner,
            can benefit from having triples in a certain order.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, the order from first snippet above can lead to more compact JSON-LD documents than the order from the second snippet
            when handled by a streaming JSON-LD processor.
            This is because the first order groups triples with the same subject,
            which can be exploited during streaming JSON-LD serialization by using the same <code>"@id"</code> key.
            The second order mixes subjects, which means that streaming JSON-LD serialization will have to assign separate <code>"@id"</code> keys
            for each triple, resulting in duplicate <code>"@id"</code> keys.
        </p>
        <p>
            Streaming JSON-LD serializations of both examples can be seen below.
        </p>

        <p>
            This section introduces <em>recommendations</em> for defining the order in an RDF dataset,
            such that it can be processed more efficiently by <em>streaming JSON-LD processors</em>.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Group triples with the same named graph.</strong>
                <br />
                Allows grouping of <code>@graph</code> nodes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Group triples with the same subject.</strong>
                <br />
                Allows grouping of <code>@id</code> keys.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Group triples with the same predicate.</strong>
                <br />
                Allows grouping of property keys.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Group triples with a given term as named graph together with triples having this term as subject.</strong>
                <br />
                Allows the combination of <code>@graph</code> nodes with <code>@id</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Group triples with a given term as object with triples having this term as subject.</strong>
                <br />
                Allows nesting of nodes within other nodes.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="note" role="note" id="triple-ordering-recommended-how">
            <p class="">
            One straightforward way to follow the first three recommendations is by sorting all triples (or quads)
            in the order <em>graph</em>, <em>subject</em>, <em>predicate</em>, <em>object</em>.
            <br />
            Existing triple stored may already perform this kind of grouping automatically.
            </p>
            <p>
            Note also that, depending on the triples,
            it might not be possible to strictly comply with all these recommendations.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            An RDF dataset that adheres to at least one of these recommendations is considered to have
            a <a href="#dfn-streaming-RDF-dataset-form" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">streaming RDF dataset form</a>.

              Hereafter, a couple of RDF datasets are listed, together with corresponding serialized JSON-LD in a streaming manner.
              Each example illustrates the importance of the recommended triple ordering within

      <h2>Streaming Processing</h2>
      <p>
          Whenever a JSON-LD document is present in <a href="#dfn-streaming-document-form" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">streaming document form</a>,
          or if an RDF dataset is present in a <a href="#dfn-streaming-RDF-dataset-form" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">streaming RDF dataset form</a>,
          a processor MAY process these in a streaming manner.
      </p>
      <p>
          This section describes high-level guidelines for processing JSON-LD in a streaming manner.
          Concretely, guidelines are given for <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/#deserialize-json-ld-to-rdf-algorithm">deserializing JSON-LD to RDF</a>, and <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/#serialize-rdf-as-json-ld-algorithm">serializing RDF to JSON-LD</a>.
          Further details on processing can be found in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/">the JSON-LD processing algorithms</a>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3 id="streaming-deserialization">Deserialization</h3>
        <p>
            A streaming deserializer MAY be implemented by considering a JSON-LD document as a stream of incoming characters.
            By reading character-by-character, a deserializer can detect the contained JSON nodes and its key-value pairs.
        </p>
        <p>
            A streaming deserializer MUST assume that the <a href="#key-ordering-required">required key ordering</a> of a <a href="#dfn-streaming-document-form" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">streaming document</a> is present. If a different order is detected, an error MUST be thrown with error code <code>"invalid streaming key order"</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first expected entry in a node is <code>@context</code>.
            If such an entry is present, all following entries in this node can make use of it, possibly inheriting parts of the context from parent nodes.
            If such an entry is not present, only contexts from parent nodes are considered for this node.
        </p>
        <p>
            If an <code>@type</code> entry (or any alias of <code>@type</code>) is detected,
            it is checked whether or not it defines a type-scoped context according to the current node's context.
            If this defines a type-scoped context, the context for the current node is overridden.
            <br />
            Additionally, the <code>@type</code> must emit <code>rdf:type</code> triples based on the current node's subject and values.
            This subject will possibly only be determined later on, which will require buffering of these incomplete triples.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            In case multiple type-scoped contexts apply,
            they must <em>not</em> be processed by order of appearance,
            but using the lexicographical order.
        </p>
        <p>
            If an <code>@id</code> entry is detected, the RDF subject for the current node is defined for later usage.
            Any other entries that are detected before <code>@id</code> must be buffered until <code>@id</code> is found, or the node closes (which sets the subject to a fresh blank node).
        </p>
        <p>
            For every other property, the default JSON-LD algorithms are followed based on the current node's subject.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an example of a system architecture of a streaming JSON-LD deserializer can be found in <a href="https://www.rubensworks.net/blog/2019/03/13/streaming-rdf-parsers/">this blog post</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="streaming-serialization">Serialization</h3>
        <p>
            A streaming JSON-LD serializer reads triples one by one,
            and outputs a JSON-LD document character-by-character,
            which can be emitted in a streaming manner.
            <br />
            This MAY be a JSON-LD document in the <a href="#dfn-streaming-document-form" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">streaming document form</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A streaming serializer can benefit from having <a href="#triple-ordering-recommended">triples ordered</a> following a <a href="#dfn-streaming-RDF-dataset-form" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">streaming RDF dataset form</a>,
            but it SHOULD NOT assume that RDF datasets follow this form in full.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a basis, a streaming serializer can produce an array of
            <a data-cite="JSON-LD11#dfn-node-object">node objects</a> or
            <a data-cite="JSON-LD11#dfn-graph-object">graph objects</a>,
            each one representing a single RDF triple/quad.
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of this base case, several optimizations can be applied to achieve a more compact representation in JSON-LD.
            These optimizations are dependent on the surrounding triples, which is determine by the overall triple order.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-syntaxt/#the-context">JSON-LD context</a>
            is passed to a streaming serializer, <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/#compaction">compaction techniques</a>
            MAY be applied.
            For instance, instead of writing properties as full IRIs, they can be <em>compacted</em> based on the presence of terms and prefixes in the context.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the chained nature of RDF lists, serializing them to JSON-LD with the <code>@list</code> keyword in a streaming way may not always be possible,
            since you may not know beforehand if a triple is part of a valid RDF list.
            Optionally, a streaming RDF serializer MAY provide an alternative method to emit <code>@list</code> keywords.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since streaming RDF processors process triples one by one,
            so that they don't need to keep all triples in memory,
            they loose the ability to deduplicate triples.
            As such, a streaming JSON-LD serializer MAY produce JSON-LD that contains duplicate triples.
